# ZeroTherapy

ZeroTherapy allows a counselor to create an AMA counseling session where the audience can join and ask questions anonymously, creating an open and safe environment. Audiences can also vote anonymously for questions to be answered (community moderation via anonymous voting).

It leverages on Semaphore and zk-proofs to preserve the userâ€™s identity.

# Features

## Counselor

- create AMA counseling sessions which may be public or secured with an access code (ie. audience would need an access code to join the AMA counseling session - useful for clients or study groups where only clients/students can join, or corporate groups where only employees can join)
- update status of the AMA counseling session
  - start: audience may join and post questions
  - pause: audience may join but cannot post questions
  - resume: audience may post questions
  - end: session has ended
- list created AMA counseling sessions

## Audience/Participant

- list AMA counseling sessions that are paused/active (ie. ready for audiences to join)
- join a public session or enter access code to join a private AMA session
- post a question to an AMA counseling session anonymously
- vote on other audience's questions anonymously

# Test with Frontend UI

- `yarn dev` to start a local node. Import a few of the test accounts into Metamask for testing purposes.
- `yarn deploy --network localhost` to deploy the smart contracts to the local node.


Copy the AMA contract address to lib/config.json
